# Wi-Fi Contention Free Period Implementation in ns-3

To implement and evaluate my MAC protocol and alternative designs, I utilize WiFi PHY layer of ns-3. The nodes in this network are defined as PhyNodes and are classified into ApPhyNode, the Access Point and StaPhyNode, the clients. The models in this repository include traffic generation at client, control and data messaging between the AP and clients, computation of performance evaluation metrics etc.
